# drone-with-object-detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code to create a drone that can detect and follow a solid coloured object. It uses a Pi for object detection and a BetaFlight flight controller. The pi uses OpenCV to detect objects and controls the drone via the Multiwii Serial Protocol.
