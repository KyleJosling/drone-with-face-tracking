# drone-with-facial-detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code to create a drone that can detect and follow a human face. I decided to use a Pi for facial detection and an Arduino for a flight controller. Could I have just used a Pi to act as the flight controller and do the facial detection? Maybe. But I decided that the facial detection was heavy enough computationally that latency and timing might be an issue while running a full operating system.
